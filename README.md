# recipe-tracker
accepts, displays, and allows for editing and deleting of recipe infromation.
Uses HTML forms via react and includes three external components, recipe-create accepts the recipe info, recipe list displays the recipe entry, 
and recipe view creates a table with the list of recipe entries along with delete and edit options.
Future possibilities include seperating the form and list views into two distinct views (main, list...).
